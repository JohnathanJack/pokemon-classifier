# Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to create an image classification model through a CNN that correctly identifies the starter pokemon: Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle and Pikachu. 

# Process
1. Obtain a dataset of pictures and filter out 'bad' pictures of the pokemon.
    -By bad, I mean no pokemon cards as our main focus is the pokemon and not the whole card itself
2. Experiment with CNN layers and choose the best model that produces the highest accuracy

# Results
Preliminary results on a small dataset show around an 80% accuracy rate for the model. The model itself fluctuates between 70-90% accuracy and increasing the number of epochs and data will definitely help stabilize the accuracy and loss.
