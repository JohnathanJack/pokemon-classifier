All pokemon is used compared to the previous models where it was only the four starter pokemons. Animal dataset was taken from the animal image dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals). Both were combined and formed to create a binary classification model that can differentiate between a real life animal and a pokemon."
